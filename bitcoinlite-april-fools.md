I propose making a joke web site for April Fools' day (April 1, 2021) that promotes Litecoin and mocks the numerous forks that attempt to profit by tagging along on the Bitcoin name. I can make some simple web content, register the domain, and then redirect traffic to the new domain over to the LTC foundation's website.
